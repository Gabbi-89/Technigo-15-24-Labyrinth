0,0 You find yourself in under a large archway opening into a cavern. A sense of purpose fills you.
0,1 You emerge into a large, four-walled room with mechanical gadgets and bronze metal gizmos laying in a mess on the floor. They seem to have once been part of some larger moving mechanism.
0,2 As you move through the room, the walls change colors with every step you take. The buzzing and clicking from before now seem to form one harmonious melody. They respond to your every movement.
0,3 The mouth of the chest swings open. The papers spring from the chest, whirling around your head. You shield your face, but an instant later all is calm. The papers, books and scrolls from the chest are now neatly arranged on the bookshelves around the room.
1,0 It's warmer here. Rays of light penetrate the the ceiling.
1,1 The walls of the cavern seem to grow brighter and more colorful here.
